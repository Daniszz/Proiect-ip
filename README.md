# ðŸ§  Language Parser for Sentence Validation

A C++ project developed in the first year of university that analyzes Romanian sentences to determine their grammatical correctness. It uses the **CYK (Cockeâ€“Youngerâ€“Kasami)** parsing algorithm to validate input sentences based on a context-free grammar (CFG) and displays the resulting parsing table.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Parses Romanian sentences using the CYK algorithm
- Validates grammatical structure based on a custom CFG
- Displays parsing table for educational/visualization purposes
- Written in clean, modular C++ for learning and readability

## ðŸ“– How It Works

1. A context-free grammar is defined in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).
2. The user inputs a sentence in Romanian.
3. The program tokenizes the input and applies the CYK algorithm.
4. A parsing table is generated and displayed in the terminal.
5. The sentence is marked as **valid** or **invalid** based on whether it can be generated from the grammar.
